###Objective
The objective of this project was to create the proof of concept of a opensourced and crowdsourced Touristic map, where the users could create points of interest at will and share their thoughts about the marked location while also giving possibility to indicate if said location have accebility for different types of disabilities.
A project that kept in mind the desire to help people share what they love about a place, to help other people find what they seek and to guide those that just want to find new places.

by people, for people.

### Version info

This app was originally generated on Mon Nov 27 2023 10:55:34 GMT-0300 (Brasilia Standard Time) using Sails v1.5.8.

<!-- Internally, Sails used [`sails-generate@2.0.8`](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-generate/tree/v2.0.8/lib/core-generators/new). -->



<!--
Note:  Generators are usually run using the globally-installed `sails` CLI (command-line interface).  This CLI version is _environment-specific_ rather than app-specific, thus over time, as a project's dependencies are upgraded or the project is worked on by different developers on different computers using different versions of Node.js, the Sails dependency in its package.json file may differ from the globally-installed Sails CLI release it was originally generated with.  (Be sure to always check out the relevant [upgrading guides](https://sailsjs.com/upgrading) before upgrading the version of Sails used by your app.  If you're stuck, [get help here](https://sailsjs.com/support).)
